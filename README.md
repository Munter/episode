A javascript utility that can parse commonly used TV-series season and episode syntaxes into structured data.

A typical use case would be to extrapolate this information from a file name, directory structure or other metadata.

Usage
-----
```javascript
var episode = require('episode');

episode('s01e04'); // { season: 1, episode: 4, matches: ['s01e04'] }
```
The season and episode of the return value can be `undefined` if no matches are made.

The matches array contains the list of matched strings that led to the result. These could be useful for replacing those strings in your input string.

Supported syntaxes
------------------
```javascript
's{number}e{number}'
's{number} e{number}'
'{number}x{number}'
'season {number} episode {number}'
'season{number} episode{number}'
'season: {number} episode: {number}'
'season:{number} episode:{number}'
```
